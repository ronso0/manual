   Mapping Manual for NUMARK MIXTRACK PLATINUM FX

-------------------------------------

**Overview**

|  The pads are for controlling cue’s, loops, and The Numark Mixtrack Platinum FX is a 2 channel (with 4 channel layering) entry level DJ controller with an integrated audio interface. The stand out feature of the Mixtrack Platinum FX is the LCD displays integrated into the jog wheels. It is a USB Audio and MIDI Class compliant device and works with Linux, macOS, and Windows.
|
| **Audio Interface**
|
| Configure Mixxxs’ Master output for channels 1-2 and Headphones output for Channels 3-4.
|
| The microphone input on this controller is not available to the computer through the controller’s audio interface. It is mixed with the master output in hardware, so this controller’s audio interface is not suitable for broadcasting or recording the inputs. If you want to use the controller for broadcasting or recording, a separate audio interface with a microphone input is suggested.

**Performance Pad Modes**

The pads are for controlling cue’s, loops, and samples via various modes. To select a mode, select a Pad Mode button (Cue, Auto Loop, Fader Cuts & Sample) to assign that functionality to the 8 pads. An LED under the pad, indicates the currently selected mode.

Further to the NORMAL Pad Mode, 2 additional layers of functionality, SHIFT & ALTERNATE is also provided, as shown in the matrix below.

**TAPPING**

Logic for the tap button:

For tapping we have to "guess" which deck is intended, so we use some pointers.

 1.we'll only consider loaded decks

 2.except in fallback we'll only consider decks on the "active" layer (unless neither on this layer are loaded)

 3.If one deck has PFL and the other doesn't we use that one (assumption that tapping bpm will be on a non playout deck)

 4.If both have the same PFL state then look if one is playing. Currently prefers the one that IS playing, could argue this the other way?

 5.If they both match then use the one with the lowest deck number

To help know which it is using when tapping BOTH up and down arrows on the deck are lit. As the first tap doesn't make any changes (you can't work out a bpm from one tap) it is safe to tap and hold the button and check which deck the arrows are showing on.

The pads are for controlling cues, loops, and samples via various modes & layers. To select a mode, select a Pad Mode button (Cue, Auto Loop, Fader Cuts & Sample) to assign that functionality to the 8 pads. An LED under the pad section indicates the currently selected
